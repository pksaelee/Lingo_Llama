 		<h3>What is Lingo Llama?</h3>
 		<h2>Welcome! Bienvenido! 欢迎!</h2>
 		<p>Thanks for coming and checking out our page! So what is Lingo Llama all about? Well, our goal here is to help none native speakers how to speak theri desired language using the three type of learning: <u>Visual</u>, <u>Auditory</u>, and <u>Kinesthetic</u>. </p>
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		<h3>What's so special about Lingo Llama?</h3>
 		<p>While man other language sites are either free, aesthetically pleasing, or useful (or maybe 2 of the three), we plan to incorporate all 3 aspects of the characteristics into this website!</p>
 		<p>Many websites we foudn is great for learning, yet it doesn't give you full access to all the resources neeed or those that are completely fre gives some language learners a struggle to understand. Not only that but their websites are a bit confusing to maneuver around (and kinda ugly too. Admit it).</p>
 		<p>Of course, we also advocate the learners to communicate with others to practice their language skills, hence our community section where you can chat through messageing or video calls (the latter will be coming soon so look forward to it). And if you're still shy about speaking with another person or afraid of possible embarassment (of course we won't let that happen since everyone starts off at shakey start), you can have a private chat with our approved<b>*</b> tutor to help you along the way and gain speaking, or messaging, confidence.</p>
 		<h6>*Tutors are not guaranteed to be professional and must go through interviews by the admin to be allowed to teach. 
 		<br>

 		<br>
 		<br>
 		<h3>OK, what next?</h3>
 		<p>That is our question to you. So what are you waiting for? Go on and start learning! It's never too late to learn an extra language or two.</p>
