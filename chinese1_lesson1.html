 		<h3>Lesson 1: Let's Start the Fun</h3>
 		<br><br><br>
 		<p>Before we get into anything foreign, we first need to know what we are getting into. Meaning how are we going to say and read it in our way right before reading it in the Chinese way. That's why we are going to start with the alphabet.</p>
 		<br>
 		<p>Now before you guys skip this lesson (and I sincerely hope you don't), this is essential for helping you read and speak the language. Especially for pronounciations.</p>
 		<p>Try this for example: Â•πÂæàÊºÇ‰∫Æ (ta hen piao liang)</p>
 		<p>No need to worry about what the words mean, and if you do know, you're in the wrong place bud„ÄÇ Go challenge yourself.</p>
 		<p>Only focus on the English text next to the Chinese characters and try reading it. We call those texts 'ping ying'.</p>
 		<p>So after reading this to yourself, you may think this isn't so bad, as long as you have those 'ping ying' next to the Chinese characters, but I guarantee 'hen' does not sound like what you would usually read it as. üêî</p>
 		<p>Don't worry if you feel stupid for probably saying it incorrectly. First time isn't always the best. That's why, we are going to first show you how the vowels are pronounced.</p>
 		<br>
 		<h2>Vowels</h2>
 		<table style="width: 50%">
 			<tr>
 				<th>a</th>
 				<th>o</th>
 				<th>e</th>
 				<th>i</th>
 				<th>u</th>
 				<th>√º</th>
 			</tr>
 			<tr>
 				<th>(ah)</th>
 				<th>(oh)</th>
 				<th>(uh)</th>
 				<th>(ee)</th>
 				<th>(ooh)</th>
 				<th>(eur)</th>
 			</tr>
 		</table>
 		<p>Here's the vowels! Different from your "a e i o u" huh? The first two should be easy for you, and for the second two, your can figure that on your own. The last one though, ouch. In my opinion, the most tricky vowel to pronounce. It's better to listen to someone else say it before you try it. But if you want to go ahead...best tip I can give is try saying ooh and err at the same time. Maybe you will get similar results?</p>
 		<br>
 		<p>And that's all for lesson one. Expecting more? Well, didn't want to wear you out, so we're gonna continue to alphabet on Lesson 2! But before you go there, I recommend that you try a keep practicing your pronouncation for each of the vowel. As well as recognize them too. "u" and "√º" may look similar, but they definitely do not sound similar.</p>
 		<!-- <h2>‰Ω†Â•Ω</h2>
 		<p>So, you have probably seen this if you browsed around the web and don't know what it mean. If you do, you're in the wrong place, bud. Go challenge yourself.</p>
 		<p>This word is read as "ni hao".</p>
 		<p>For a first timer that may have never heard of this word before, I'm guaranteeing that you are butchering it right now, but don't worry. Everyone does that on their first time. Imagine someone from another country trying the learn your language. Just don't be embarrassed, that's all.</p>
 		<p>For those of you who recognize the word and manage to say it with the right tone, great job! This first world means "hello."</p>
 		<br><br><br>
 		<p>So what are we trying to teach here</p> -->
