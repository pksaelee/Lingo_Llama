 		<h3> üòÉ ‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅWelcome to Chinese! üòÉ</h3>
 		<h4>Begin your Chinese journey by choose one of the levels below that you feel that is just right for you.</h4>
 		<div class="container">
 			<div><a href="chinese1.html"><button class="button"><span>Absolute Beginner </span></button></a></div>
 			<p>No clue on how to say hello in this language? Then this level is a great place to start!</p>
 			<br>
 			<br>
 			<div><a href="comingSoon.html"><button class="button"><span>Beginner </span></button></a></div>
 			<p> You may probably know a word or two in this particular language, even the basic words passed just "hello" and "good-bye". Maybe can't formulate a cohesive sentence. And barely can read. Don't worry, we got your back here.
 			<br>
 			<br>
 			<div><a href="comingSoon.html"><button class="button"><span>Intermediate </span></button></a></div>
 			<p>Okay, so now you know how to form a basic sentence, probably at a ten-year old level. That's okay! Here we're going to go in more depth on different words you can use and slightly a more advanced way of speaking. AKA Grammar.</p>
 			<br>
 			<br>
 			<div><a href="comingSoon.html"><button class="button"><span>Advanced </span></button></a></div>
 			<p>If you are looking to click on this button, then we have to assume that you're pretty good at this language, although not pro yet. I mean we're here to teach you, not test your skills on how easy you can breeze this. Time to learn some culture.</p>
